Generally, street lights are switched on for whole night and during the day, they are switched off. 
But during the night time, street lights are not necessary if there is no traffic. 
Saving of this energy is very important factor these days as energy resources are getting reduced day by day.

Alternatives for natural resources are very less and our next generations may face lot of problems because of lack of these natural resources. 
This project describes about the circuit that switches the street lights on detecting vehicle movement and remains off after fixed time.
