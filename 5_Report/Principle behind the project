The proposed system consists of Atmega8 microcontroller, LDR, PIR sensor(push button) and RTC.
This system controls the street lights using light dependent resistor and PIR sensor.

Street lights are switched on depending on the intensity of the Sun light on LDR. 
If the intensity of Sunlight on light dependent resistor is low, its resistance value is high. 
This value increases and becomes high when it is completely in dark. This resistance value decides when the street lights are required to switch ON.

As the resistance value is maximum in the midnights, real time clock comes into the play. 
The controller checks peak time during which there is no traffic and switch OFF the lights.
When there is any vehicle on the road, it is detected by the PIR sensor.

Whenever PIR sensor is detected it just indicates the microcontroller to switch on the street lights.
Then lights are switched on for 2 to 3 minutes and switched off automatically.
