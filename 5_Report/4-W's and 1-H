WHAT:


Generally, street lights are switched on for whole night and during the day, they are switched off.
But during the night time, street lights are not necessary if there is no traffic.
Saving of this energy is very important factor these days as energy resources are getting reduced day by day.

WHY:

Street Lights are turned ON only when there is necessity and thus encouraging power savings.
In order to ensure that there is no uneccesary power wastage


WHEN:

We can us this system anytime we want to switch On or Off the street lights accordingly


WHO:

Everyone who wants to save energy and avoid wastage of electricity


HOW:

Street lights are switched on depending on the intensity of the Sun light on LDR. If the intensity of Sunlight on light dependent resistor is low,
its resistance value is high. This value increases and becomes high when it is completely in dark. 
This resistance value decides when the street lights are required to switch ON.
