PROJECT TITLE:

STREET LIGHTS THAT GLOW ON VEHICLE MOVEMENT

DESCRIPTION:

Generally, street lights are switched on for whole night and during the day, they are switched off.
But during the night time, street lights are not necessary if there is no traffic. 
Saving of this energy is very important factor these days as energy resources are getting reduced day by day.
Alternatives for natural resources are very less and our next generations may face lot of problems because of lack of these natural resources.
This project describes about the circuit that switches the street lights on detecting vehicle movement and remains off after fixed time. 

PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS CIRCUIT:

The proposed system consists of Atmega8 microcontroller, LDR, PIR sensor and RTC. 
This system controls the street lights using light dependent resistor and PIR sensor.Street lights are switched on depending on the intensity of the Sun light on LDR.
If the intensity of Sunlight on light dependent resistor is low, its resistance value is high. 
This value increases and becomes high when it is completely in dark. This resistance value decides when the street lights are required to switch ON.
As the resistance value is maximum in the midnights, real time clock comes into the play. 
The controller checks peak time during which there is no traffic and switch OFF the lights. 
When there is any vehicle on the road, it is detected by the PIR sensor.
Whenever PIR sensor is detected it just indicates the microcontroller to switch on the street lights.
Then lights are switched on for 2 to 3 minutes and switched off automatically.
Another way to this approach is, one can maintain minimum intensity without completely switching off the lights by using PWM and switch them on to maximum intensity 
whenever it detects the vehicle. But in this project the circuit is designed in such a way that lights are completely switched OFF
and will be switched ON only when there is any vehicle. 

APPLICATIONS:

==>The street light control circuit can be used in normal roads, highways, express ways etc.
==>The project can also be used in parking areas of malls, hotels, industrial lighting, etc.

ADVANTAGES:

==>If the lighting system implements all LED lights, the cost of the maintenance can be reduced as the life span and durability of LEDs is higher
than Neon based lights which are normally used as street lights.
==>As the lights are automatically turned ON or OFF, huge amount of energy can be saved.
